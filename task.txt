Great choices! Here’s a breakdown of key features for each project to help guide your development:

Interactive 3D Carousel

1.3D Rotation: Implement smooth 3D rotation with swipe gestures or arrow keys. Consider using `CSS3D` or `three.js` for realistic animations.
2.Dynamic Content Loading: Fetch images or content dynamically from an API or local JSON file, allowing the carousel to load different items on demand.
3.Clickable Items: Make each item clickable to display more information in a modal or on a new page.
4.Autoplay and Controls: Add an autoplay feature with adjustable speed settings, along with buttons to pause/resume and navigate left or right.
5.Perspective and Depth Effects: Use CSS or `three.js` to add a sense of depth, so items at the center appear larger and more prominent than those at the edges.
6.Responsive Design: Ensure the carousel adapts smoothly to different screen sizes, particularly mobile.
7.Lazy Loading: Load images only when they come into view to improve performance, especially if dealing with large image sets.

Task Management App

1.Task Creation and Editing: Allow users to create, edit, and delete tasks with details like title, description, due date, and priority level.
2.Drag-and-Drop Task Organization: Implement a Kanban-style board where tasks can be moved between columns (like To Do, In Progress, Done) using drag-and-drop.
3.Due Date and Priority Notifications: Set up notifications or color-coded alerts for upcoming or overdue tasks and high-priority items.
4.Task Filters and Search: Add filters to view tasks by status, priority, or due date, and a search feature to quickly locate specific tasks.
5.Progress Tracking: Show a visual indicator (e.g., percentage or progress bar) to give users a quick overview of completed tasks.
6.User Authentication: Optional but powerful—allow users to create an account, log in, and have their tasks saved to a database.
7.Collaboration Tools: For a more advanced twist, add functionality for multiple users to collaborate on the same tasks with user roles or permissions.
8.Data Persistence: Store tasks in a database (or in local storage for simpler implementations) to retain task data even after refresh.
