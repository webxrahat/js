Task Management App

1.Task Creation and Editing: Allow users to create, edit, and delete tasks with details like title, description, due date, and priority level.
2.Drag-and-Drop Task Organization: Implement a Kanban-style board where tasks can be moved between columns (like To Do, In Progress, Done) using drag-and-drop.
3.Due Date and Priority Notifications: Set up notifications or color-coded alerts for upcoming or overdue tasks and high-priority items.
4.Task Filters and Search: Add filters to view tasks by status, priority, or due date, and a search feature to quickly locate specific tasks.
5.Progress Tracking: Show a visual indicator (e.g., percentage or progress bar) to give users a quick overview of completed tasks.
6.User Authentication: Optional but powerfulâ€”allow users to create an account, log in, and have their tasks saved to a database.
7.Collaboration Tools: For a more advanced twist, add functionality for multiple users to collaborate on the same tasks with user roles or permissions.
8.Data Persistence: Store tasks in a database (or in local storage for simpler implementations) to retain task data even after refresh.
